# Kickstarter-Analysis
Performing an analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to provide Louise the info she needs to run a successful Kickstarter.  
This was dont by analyzing a dataset of previous Kickstarter campaigns fo identify traits and similarities  
between succesful and failed campaigns.  

## Analyses and Challenges
I analyzed the goals and actual amounts pledged for the successful and failed campaigns. I also looked  
at the Category and Sucategory statistics and success rates, as well as outcomes based on launch dates.  
Doing this sheds light on whether certain categories of campaign tend to be more successful and if launch  
date might influence the outcome. One challenge of this analysis was the fact that the dataset contained  
some live and cancelled campaigns and I had to be sure to filter them out when necessary. Another challenge  
was to further investigate correlation when present, despite causation seemin apparent.  

## Results
There can be many observations made of this data. Among the most important are the findings relating to Launch   
Date, Subcategory, and Goals. It is clear that Campaigns tend to have the most success when launched in the   
Months of May and June. Thus, I would strongly advise launching in those two months if at all possible. Secondly,   
Subcategory seems to play a strong role in a campaigns likelihood of success. A second comclusion that can be observed  
is that launch date has much less of a bearing on failure rate. This should be good news for Louise   
because an initial glance at the overall success rate would be misleading (before filtering out other subcategories)  
Regarding the findings based on a campaign's goals there were mixed results. Projects with below 15,000 and between 35,000   
and 40,000 had a higher percentage of successes than failures. With such staggered ranges it may be useful to pull some   
of the most successful campaigns with similar goals and further examing them outside of the dataset, but this dataset is  
limited and does not provide further data on their most successful campaigns (if possible)   
Other graphs that might be useful in the future are time to hit pledge goal (rather than deadline) because people might donate  
at lower rates once the goal is reached. Another useful graph might be the nature of the donation. For example, it would be   
more useful to know how many donations were from institutions vs more organic donations from people. Knowing the various   
demographics of those people would also be especially useful along with donation size.
